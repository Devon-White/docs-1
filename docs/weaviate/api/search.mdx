Weaviate offers [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and gRPC APIs for queries.

However, you can query Weaviate directly using GraphQL with a POST request to the `/graphql` endpoint, or write your own `gRPC` calls based on the [gRPC](#protobuf-definitions) protobuf specification.

All references have their individual subpages. Click on one of the references below for more information.

- [Object-level queries](./graphql/get.md)
- [Aggregate](./graphql/aggregate.md)
- [Search operators](./graphql/search-operators.md)
- [Conditional filters](./graphql/filters.md)
- [Additional operators](./graphql/additional-operators.md)
- [Additional properties](./graphql/additional-properties.md)
- [Explore](./graphql/explore.md)

:::tip

We recommend using a Weaviate [client library](../client-libraries/index.mdx), which abstracts away the underlying API calls and makes it easier to integrate Weaviate into your application.

## GraphQL API

### Why GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language built on using graph data structures. It is an efficient method of data retrieval and mutation, since it mitigates the common over-fetching and under-fetching problems of other query languages.

:::tip GraphQL is case-sensitive
GraphQL is case-sensitive ([reference](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names)), so make sure to use the correct casing when writing your queries.
:::

### Query structure

You can POST a GraphQL query to Weaviate as follows:

```bash
curl http://localhost/v1/graphql -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{GraphQL query}'
```

A GraphQL JSON object is defined as:

```json
{
  "query": "{ # GRAPHQL QUERY }"
}
```

GraphQL queries follow a defined structure. Queries are structured as follows:

```graphql
{
  <Function> {
      <Collection> {
        <property>
        _<underscore-property>
      }
  }
}
```

### Limitations

GraphQL _integer_ data currently only supports `int32`, and does not support `int64`. This means that currently _integer_ data fields in Weaviate with integer values larger than `int32`, will not be returned using GraphQL queries. We are working on solving this [issue](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/1563). As current workaround is to use a `string` instead.

### Consistency level

GraphQL (`Get`) queries are run with a tunable [consistency level](../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#tunable-read-consistency).

## gRPC API

Starting with Weaviate `v1.19.0`, a gRPC interface has been progressively added to Weaviate. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that is contract-based and can be used in any environment. It is based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, and is therefore very fast and efficient.

As of Weaviate `v1.23.7`, the gRPC interface is considered stable. The [Python (`v4` version)](/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/python) and [TypeScript (`v3` version)](../client-libraries/typescript/index.mdx) client libraries support gRPC, and the other client libraries will follow.

### Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) definitions {#protobuf-definitions}

A gRPC interface is defined through its Protocol Buffer, or Protobuf ([read more](https://protobuf.dev/)) definitions.

In the case of Weaviate, the `.proto` files are listed in the Core library's [proto directory](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/tree/master/grpc/proto/v1).

This directory contains the following files:

- `weaviate.proto`: The main Protobuf definition file. This file defines the `Weaviate` service, and specifies the RPC methods available in the Weaviate service.
- `batch.proto`: Defines data structures for handling batch object operations. This file is imported by `weaviate.proto`.
- `search_get.proto`: Defines data structures for handling search (get) operations. This file is imported by `weaviate.proto`.
- `base.proto`: Defines base data structures to be used elsewhere. This file is imported by `batch.proto` and `search_get.proto`.

### How to use gRPC

#### Server-side

As an example, the snippet below maps `50051` as the host port so that it can be accessed from outside the container. The `50051` port is mapped to the `50051` port inside the container for gRPC calls, and the `8080` port is mapped to the `8080` port inside the container for REST calls.

:::info
We suggest using the default port `50051` for gRPC calls. It can be modified through the `GRPC_PORT` [environment variable](/docs/weaviate/config-refs/env-vars).  
Note that [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) uses port `443` for gRPC.
:::

````yaml:

```yaml
---
services:
  weaviate:
    # ... Other settings
    ports:
     - "8080:8080"  # REST calls
     - "50051:50051"  # gRPC calls
  # ... Other settings
````

#### Client-side

You can use the gRPC interface through the [Python (`v4` version)](/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/python) and [TypeScript (`v3` version)](../client-libraries/typescript/index.mdx) client libraries. Other client libraries will also introduce gRPC support in the near future.

Alternatively, you can use other tools, such as the `grpcurl` command-line tool, to interact with the gRPC API. Some options include:

- `grpcurl` command-line tool ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl))
- Postman ([How to send a gRPC request with Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-request-interface/))
