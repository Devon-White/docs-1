## Helper classes

The client library provides numerous additional Python classes to provide IDE assistance and typing help. You can import them individually, like so:

```
from weaviate.classes.config import Property, ConfigFactory
from weaviate.classes.data import DataObject
from weaviate.classes.query import Filter
```

But it may be convenient to import the whole set of classes like this. You will see both usage styles in our documentation.

```
import weaviate.classes as wvc
```

For discoverability, the classes are arranged into submodules.

| Module                       | Description                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `weaviate.classes.config`    | Collection creation / modification |
| `weaviate.classes.data`      | CUD operations                     |
| `weaviate.classes.query`     | query/search operations            |
| `weaviate.classes.aggregate` | aggregate operations               |
| `weaviate.classes.generic`   | generics                           |
| `weaviate.classes.init`      | initialization                     |
| `weaviate.classes.tenants`   | tenants                            |
| `weaviate.classes.batch`     | batch operations                   |

## Connection termination

You must ensure your client connections are closed. You can use `client.close()`, or use a context manager to close client connections for you.

### `client.close()` with `try` / `finally`

This will close the client connection when the `try` block is complete (or if an exception is raised).

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# TryFinallyExample"
  endMarker="# END TryFinallyExample"
  language="py"
/>

### Context manager

This will close the client connection when you leave the `with` block.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# ClientContextManagerExample"
  endMarker="# END ClientContextManagerExample"
  language="py"
/>

## Exception handling

The client library raises exceptions for various error conditions. These include, for example:

- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateConnectionError` for failed connections.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateQueryError` for failed queries.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateBatchError` for failed batch operations.
- `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateClosedClientError` for operations on a closed client.

Each of these exceptions inherit from `weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateBaseError`, and can be caught using this base class, as shown below.

<FilteredTextBlock
    text={PythonCode}
    startMarker="# START BrokenQueryExample"
    endMarker="# END BrokenQueryExample"
    language="py"
/>

You can review [this module](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/blob/main/weaviate/exceptions.py) which defines the exceptions that can be raised by the client library.

The client library doc strings also provide information on the exceptions that can be raised by each method. You can view these by using the `help` function in Python, by using the `?` operator in Jupyter notebooks, or by using an IDE, such as hover-over tooltips in VSCode.

## Thread-safety

While the Python client is fundamentally designed to be thread-safe, it's important to note that due to its dependency on the `requests` library, complete thread safety isn't guaranteed.

This is an area that we are looking to improve in the future.

:::warning Thread safety
The batching algorithm in our client is not thread-safe. Keep this in mind to help ensure smoother, more predictable operations when using our Python client in multi-threaded environments.
:::

If you are performing batching in a multi-threaded scenario, ensure that only one of the threads is performing the batching workflow at any given time. No two threads can use the same `client.batch` object at one time.

## Response object structure

Each query response object typically include multiple attributes. Consider this query.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultDisplayExample"
  endMarker="# END ResultDisplayExample"
  language="py"
/>

Each response includes attributes such as `objects` and `generated`. Then, each object in `objects` include multiple attributes such as `uuid`, `vector`, `properties`, `references`, `metadata` and `generated`.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultDisplayOutput"
  endMarker="# END ResultDisplayOutput"
  language="bash"
/>

To limit the response payload, you can specify which properties and metadata to return.

<!-- Additionally, to view the response object in a more readable format, you can use the `json.dumps()` function as shown below

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultJSONDisplayExample"
  endMarker="# END ResultJSONDisplayExample"
  language="bash"
/>

This is the formatted output.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START ResultJSONDisplayResults"
  endMarker="# END ResultJSONDisplayResults"
  language="bash"
/> -->

## Input argument validation

The client library performs input argument validation by default to make sure that the input types match the expected types.

You can disable this validation to improve performance. You can do this by setting the `skip_argument_validation` parameter to `True` when you instantiate a collection object, with `collections.get`, or with `collections.create` for example.

<FilteredTextBlock
  text={PythonCode}
  startMarker="# START SkipValidationExample"
  endMarker="# END SkipValidationExample"
  language="bash"
/>

This may be useful in cases where you are using the client library in a production environment, where you can be confident that the input arguments are typed correctly.

## Tab completion in Jupyter notebooks

If you use a browser to run the Python client with a Jupyter notebook, press `Tab` for code completion while you edit. If you use VSCode to run your Jupyter notebook, press `control` + `space` for code completion.

## Raw GraphQL queries

To provide raw GraphQL queries, you can use the `client.graphql_raw_query` method (previously `client.query.raw` in the `v3` client). This method takes a string as input.
