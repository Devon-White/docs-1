## Instantiate a client

The v3 client provides helper functions to connect your application to your Weaviate instance.

[Embedded Weaviate](/docs/weaviate/installation/embedded) is not supported in the v3 client. The v2 client supports embedded Weaviate.

### Connect to Weaviate

<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="wcd" label="WCD">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", {
  // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"),
  headers: {
    "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "", // Replace with your inference API key
  },
});

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToLocal();

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom" label="Custom">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToCustom({
  httpHost: "localhost",
  httpPort: 8080,
  grpcHost: "localhost",
  grpcPort: 50051,
  grpcSecure: true,
  httpSecure: true,
  authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"),
  headers: {
    "X-Cohere-Api-Key": process.env.COHERE_API_KEY || "", // Replace with your inference API key
  },
});

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Close client method

import TSClientClose from "/_includes/clients/ts-client-close.mdx";

<TSClientClose />

### Authentication

import ClientAuthApiKey from "/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/_components/client.auth.api.key.mdx";

<ClientAuthApiKey />

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from "weaviate-client";

// Instantiate the client with the auth config
const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  "WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"), // Add your WCD API KEY here
  }
);

console.log(client);
```

To include custom headers, such as API keys for third party services, add the custom headers to the `headers` section when you initialize the client:

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from "weaviate-client";

const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  "WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"), // Add your WCD API KEY here
    headers: {
      someHeaderName: "header-value",
    },
  }
);
```

The client sends the headers every it makes a request to the Weaviate instance.

## Generics

TypeScript users can define custom Generics. Generics make it easier to manipulate objects and their properties. Compile time type checks help to ensure that operations like `insert()` and `create()` are safe and error free.

```js
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

type Article = {
  title: string,
  body: string,
  wordcount: number,
};

const collection = client.collections.get < Article > "Article";
await collection.data.insert({
  // compiler error since 'body' field is missing in '.insert'
  title: "TS is awesome!",
  wordcount: 9001,
});
```

## Iterator Method

The cursor API has a new iterator method. To repeat an action over an entire collection, use `iterator()`.

```js
const articles = client.collections.get("Article");

for await (const article of articles.iterator()) {
  // do something with article.
  console.log(article); // we print each object in the collection
}
```

## Type Safety

The v3 client enables strong typing with custom TypeScript types and user-defined generics.

You can find the type definitions in the folder that stores your Weaviate client package. The package is stored in a folder under the `node/` directory. Custom type definitions are stored in sub-folder for each bundle.

For example, the `index.d.ts` file stores type definitions for the `cjs` bundle:

```bash
node/cjs/index.d.ts
```

The v3 client also adds internal features that make JavaScript development more type-safe.
