:::info

The TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

The **v3 client** is the current TypeScript client. If you have code written for the v2 client, you should migrate it to v3.

The [v2 client](/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2) version is still available in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-ts-client?activeTab=versions), however you should not use it to begin new projects except if you need browser based web client development.

:::

:::note TypeScript client version
The latest TypeScript client is version `v||site.typescript_client_version||`.

import TSClientIntro from "/_includes/clients/ts-client-intro.mdx";

<TSClientIntro />

If you are migrating a project from the Weaviate TypeScript client v2 to the v3 client, see the [migration page](/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/v2_v3_migration) for additional details.

## Client configuration

This section details how install and configure the v3 TypeScript client.

### Install the package

The v3 client package has a new name, `weaviate-client`. Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the TypeScript client library package:

```bash
npm install weaviate-client
```

### Import the Client

The v3 client uses `ES Modules`. Most of the sample code in the documentation also uses the `ES Module` style.

If your code requires `CommonJS` compatibility, use the `CommonJS` import style:

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="esm" label="ES Modules">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cjs" label="CommonJS">

```ts
const weaviate = require("weaviate-client").default;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### TypeScript setup

Edit your project's configuration files to make these changes:

- Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`
- Add the following code to [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

<details>
    <summary>tsconfig.json file</summary>

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["src/index.ts"] // this compiles only src/.index.ts, to compile all .ts files, use ["*.ts"]
}
```

</details>

## Connect a client

The v3 client provides helper functions to connect your application to your Weaviate instance.

[Embedded Weaviate](/docs/weaviate/installation/embedded) is not supported in the v3 client. The v2 client supports embedded Weaviate.

### Connect to Weaviate

<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="wcd" label="WCD">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", {
  // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"),
  headers: {
    "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "", // Replace with your inference API key
  },
});

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToLocal();

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom" label="Custom">

```ts
import weaviate from "weaviate-client";

const client = await weaviate.connectToCustom({
  httpHost: "localhost",
  httpPort: 8080,
  grpcHost: "localhost",
  grpcPort: 50051,
  grpcSecure: true,
  httpSecure: true,
  authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"),
  headers: {
    "X-Cohere-Api-Key": process.env.COHERE_API_KEY || "", // Replace with your inference API key
  },
});

console.log(client);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Close client method

import TSClientClose from "/_includes/clients/ts-client-close.mdx";

<TSClientClose />

### Authentication

import ClientAuthApiKey from "/docs/weaviate/client-libraries/_components/client.auth.api.key.mdx";

<ClientAuthApiKey />

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from "weaviate-client";

// Instantiate the client with the auth config
const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  "WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"), // Add your WCD API KEY here
  }
);

console.log(client);
```

To include custom headers, such as API keys for third party services, add the custom headers to the `headers` section when you initialize the client:

```ts
import weaviate, { WeaviateClient } from "weaviate-client";

const client: WeaviateClient = await weaviate.connectToWeaviateCloud(
  "WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL", // Replace WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_URL with your instance URL
  {
    authCredentials: new weaviate.ApiKey("WEAVIATE_INSTANCE_API_KEY"), // Add your WCD API KEY here
    headers: {
      someHeaderName: "header-value",
    },
  }
);
```

The client sends the headers every it makes a request to the Weaviate instance.

## Example code

It is recommended to take a look at our [Typescript quick start](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart-typescript) to get started with using the client. We have a more in-depth course; [TS_101: Working with text data](/docs/academy/js/starter_text_data) in Weaviate on our academy that uses the client. In addition, here are some resources to help you get started using the client.

### Recipes

The [recipes repository](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts) (a W.I.P) on GitHub has sample code for common use cases.

### Demo applications

There are demo applications written in TypeScript and JavaScript here:

- [QuoteFinder](https://github.com/weaviate/quote-finder/tree/main): A hybrid, and vector search application to search through famous quotes built with React (Next.js), OpenAI and Weaviate.
- [Nuxt Vector Search](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/nuxt-vector-search): A vector search and RAG application to search through Wikipedia pages with Vue (Nuxt.js), OpenAI and Weaviate.
- [Next Vector Search](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/next-vector-search): A vector search and RAG application to search through Wikipedia pages with React (Next.js), OpenAI and Weaviate.
- [Next Multimodal Search](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/next-multimodal-search-demo): A multimodal search application to search through images with React (Next.js), Google Vertex AI and Weaviate.
- [Nuxt Multimodal Search](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/nuxt-multimodal-search): A multimodal search application to search through images with Vue (Nuxt.js), Google Vertex AI and Weaviate.
- [FlickPicker](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/flick-picker): A multimodal search application with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) functionality to search through images with Vue (Nuxt.js), Google Vertex AI and Weaviate.
- [Nuxt eCommerce RAG](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/nuxt-ecommerce-rag): An eCommerce site with vector search and RAG to search through outdoor product listing and help you plan hikes built with Vue (Nuxt.js), OpenAI and Weaviate.
