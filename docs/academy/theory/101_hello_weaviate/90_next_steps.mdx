After reading this theoretical overview of Weaviate, you may be interested in getting hands-on. If so, we recommend you to check out one of the Python or TypeScript/JavaScript courses in the Academy.

We have the following beginner courses available for Python:
- [101T Work with: Text data](../../py/starter_text_data/index.md)
- [101V Work with: Your own vectors](../../py/starter_custom_vectors/index.md)
- [101T Work with: Multimodal data](../../py/starter_multimodal_data/index.md)

And for TypeScript/JavaScript:
- [Introduction to Weaviate with TypeScript](/docs/academy/js/starter_text_data)
