Congratulations. You have successfully deployed Weaviate on your Kubernetes cluster, and scaled it to a multi-node setup. ðŸŽ‰

You can now explore the following resources to learn more about Weaviate and how to use it:

We have the following beginner courses available for Python:
- [101T Work with: Text data](../../py/starter_text_data/index.md)
- [101V Work with: Your own vectors](../../py/starter_custom_vectors/index.md)
- [101T Work with: Multimodal data](../../py/starter_multimodal_data/index.md)

And for TypeScript/JavaScript:
- [Introduction to Weaviate with TypeScript](/docs/academy/js/starter_text_data)

What you could explore, then, is how to adapt these examples to a multi-node case with replication and/or sharding.

### Related documentation

If you are interested in the architecture behind replication and sharding, please check out the following resources:
- [Replication](/docs/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/index.md)
- [Horizontal scaling](/docs/weaviate/concepts/cluster.md)

Then, check out the section on [resource planning](/docs/weaviate/concepts/resources.md) to estimate how much resources each node of a particular size might be able to handle, and how to plan your cluster accordingly.

If you have replication configured, you can apply [tunable consistency](/docs/weaviate/configuration/replication.md) concepts to read/write operations as well as queries.
