:::info Added in v1.24.0
Collections support multiple named vectors.
:::

Collections can have multiple [named vectors](/docs/weaviate/config-refs/schema/multi-vector). The vectors in a collection can have their own configurations, and compression must be enabled independently for each vector. Every vector is independent and can use [PQ](/docs/weaviate/configuration/compression/pq-compression), [BQ](/docs/weaviate/configuration/compression/bq-compression), [SQ](/docs/weaviate/configuration/compression/sq-compression), or no compression.
