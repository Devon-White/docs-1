:::info Dynamic index requires `ASYNC_INDEXING`
Dynamic indexes require asynchronous indexing. To enable asynchronous indexing in a self-hosted Weaviate instance, set the `ASYNC_INDEXING` [environment variable](/docs/deploy/config-guides/env-vars/index.md#general) to `true`. If your instance is hosted in Weaviate Cloud, use the  Weaviate Cloud console to enable asynchronous indexing.
